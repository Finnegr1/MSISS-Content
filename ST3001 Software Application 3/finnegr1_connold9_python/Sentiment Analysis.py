It was one of 4 hotels that were included in our travel package to 4 cities in Ireland.
It was by far the biggest disappointment.
The hotel was not clean - we were given a room that had been a party room the night before. The carpet had been cleaned and was still soaking wet!!!
We had to be moved 3 times before we found a satisfactory room. The Salt Hill hotel is a much nicer place. Bar was not bad though - we met some very nice people there.
